    ">In Peterson (2021)'s article, the author explores the effects of cuts to newspaper staff on political news coverage.<br><br>To measure the *outcome* or left-hand-side variable, **political news coverage**, the author used two sources: one from **Newsbank** and one from **Proquest**. They are measuring the same outcome, which is the **number of political news stories** in a newspaper over a year. The two sources of data differ slightly in terms of the time period they cover and in measurement, but they are measuring the same thing.<br><br>To measure the key explanatory or right-hand-side variable, **the number and role of reporters** in a newspaper over a particular year, the author also used two sources: **ASNE** (American Society of News Editors) census and **Newspaper Directories**.<br><br> Every row in the dataset where this regression was run represents one newspaper in one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 that we looked at in lecture lumped reporters of all kinds together. But maybe political news coverage declines more when a newspaper has fewer _political reporters_ in particular?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, the author also made a Table, Table 5. Today, we'll be interpreting Table 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 5 compares the results when using the overall _all reporters_ measure when when using using multiple right-hand-side variables that split out the number of reporters at each paper in each year _by role_. (E.g., one variable just counting the number of political reporters at a given newspaper at a given year vs. just the number of entertainment reporters at that newspaper that year; both would be included in the all reporters measure we looked at previously).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the paper says about Table 5: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Table 5 presents the results from...regressions that separate the staffing categories while still employing [the same control variables used in Table 1]. The first three columns consider the relationship [between the number of political news articles published and the number of reporters] using the Proquest measure of political news coverage moving from the specification combining all newspaper reporters together (also displayed in Table 1, Model 4), to one that separates entertainment reporters from those on political or general news beats, to one that examines each staffing category individually. The last three columns of Table 5 move through these same steps using the NewsBank measure of coverage, which is available for a slightly larger sample."
