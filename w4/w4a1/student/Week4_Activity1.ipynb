    "Many companies and organizations have workplace wellness programs that encourage employees to live healthier lives. (<a href=\"https://hr.berkeley.edu/hr-network/central-guide-managing-hr/managing-hr/wellness/health-safety/services/health-matters\" target=\"_blank\">Berkeley has one too!</a>) One reason is that companies/organizations have to pay higher health insurance costs if their employees use lots of expensive medical care. So, **workplace wellness programs try to encourage employees to live healthier lives, with the goal of reducing the amount of money the employees spend on medical care---thereby reducing how much money the company has to spend on employee health insurance**.\n",
