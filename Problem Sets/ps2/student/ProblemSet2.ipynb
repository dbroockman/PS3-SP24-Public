    "- Just like with your in-class assignments, most of the questions in this problem set will be automatically graded. Therefore, you need to answer the questions exactly as we asked them: if we ask you to compute something, write the code to compute that exact value.\n",
    "- The coding questions below will tell you if you have the right or wrong answer if you run your code and then run the `ottr::check` cell just below it. (The multiple choice questions do not do this.)\n",
    "    - You'll know you got a question right if it says `\"All tests passed!\"` afterwards.\n",
    "    - If you see an error when you run the check cell, it means you got the question wrong and should try again. The question should show a hint.\n",
    "    - If you don't see anything when you run the check cell, this means the question doesn't tell you if you got the right or wrong answer.\n",
    "- Some of the questions below are short answer questions and will be graded by a GSI. For these questions, we expect around 2-3 sentences on average. You just need to write enough to answer the question, don't stress about how short your answer is. To encourage you not to write too much, your GSI will only mark the first 60 words to your answer. For many of these questions, you do *not* need to write all 60 words.\n",
    "- Do *not* convert your answers from decimals to percentages. For example, if you are asked the proportion of voters in `data` who are female, simply present `mean(data$female)` as your answer. Do *not* multiply the expression by 100 to obtain a percentage.\n",
    "- **IF YOU EMAIL YOUR GSI A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CODE, PLEASE ATTACH YOUR NOTEBOOK AS A .PDF IN YOUR EMAIL TO YOUR GSI SO THAT YOUR GSI CAN SEE ALL OF YOUR CODE. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE NOTEBOOK AS A .PDF BY GOING TO FILE $\\rightarrow$ DOWNLOAD AS $\\rightarrow$ PDF.**\n",

    "\n",
    "In class, we analyzed data from the very first study of social pressure mailers, which are mailers that \"shame\" people into voting by revealing whether they vote to their neighbors. As you might remember, this study found that these mailers had very large effects on voter turnout.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these mailers also inspired a lot of outrage among people who disliked being shamed -- and as a result, many campaigns looked for ways to deploy \"social pressure\" in a \"gentler\" way while retaining its effectiveness. There have now been dozens of studies that look at approaches for deploying \"gentler\" social pressure to increase voter turnout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gerber et al. had one such idea for a \"gentle\" social pressure mailer. Their mailer looks like the below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"mailer.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The mail is much less harsh than the \"neighbors\" mailing in the original \"social pressure\" experiment we analyzed in class. But the mail still contains a number of social pressure elements:\n",
    "- by listing voters' own turnout history, it shows voters that the researchers know whether they vote\n",
    "- the voters are shown others' turnout history, and their own voter history is compared, providing a gentle dose of \"shame\" if their turnout history is below average or \"praise\" if it is above average\n",
    "- the voters are told that whether they vote is public\n",
    "- the P.S. tells voters that the organization may call voters to ask about their experience voting; this might be an awkward call if the person doesn't vote! The thought is that, by gently letting voters know there might be a call, voters will vote to avoid an awkward conversation about the fact that they didn't vote.\n",

    "The authors of the study we are analyzing in this problem set conducted an experiment on the effects of this mailer on voter turnout. The cell below reads in the data from this experiment."
