    "- Just like with your in-class assignments, most of the questions in this problem set will be automatically graded. Therefore, you need to answer the questions exactly as we asked them: if we ask you to compute something, write the code to compute that exact value.\n",
    "- The coding questions below will tell you if you have the right or wrong answer if you run your code and then run the `ottr::check` cell just below it. (The multiple choice questions do not do this.)\n",
    "    - You'll know you got a question right if it says `\"All tests passed!\"` afterwards.\n",
    "    - If you see an error when you run the check cell, it means you got the question wrong and should try again. The question should show a hint.\n",
    "    - If you don't see anything when you run the check cell, this means the question doesn't tell you if you got the right or wrong answer.\n",
    "- Some of the questions below are short answer questions and will be graded by a GSI. For these questions, we expect around 1-2 sentences on average. You just need to write enough to answer the question, don't stress about how short your answer is. To encourage you not to write too much, your GSI will only mark the first 60 words to your answer. For many of these questions, you do *not* need to write all 60 words.\n",
    "- Do *not* convert your answers from decimals to percentages. For example, if you are asked the proportion of voters in `data` who are female, simply present `mean(data$female)` as your answer. Do *not* multiply the expression by 100 to obtain a percentage.\n",
    "- **IF YOU EMAIL YOUR GSI A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CODE, PLEASE ATTACH YOUR NOTEBOOK AS A .PDF IN YOUR EMAIL TO YOUR GSI SO THAT YOUR GSI CAN SEE ALL OF YOUR CODE. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE NOTEBOOK AS A .PDF BY GOING TO FILE $\\rightarrow$ DOWNLOAD AS $\\rightarrow$ PDF.**\n",

    "> For each survey, a representative sample of 1,500 respondents is selected from YouGov’s U.S. research panel. Panelists are invited to each survey, based upon their age, gender, race, and education, in proportion to their frequency to the frequency of adult citizens in the most recent American Community Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The American Community Survey is a rigorous measurement of characteristics of the US population from the US Census.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey asked respondents whether they agreed with ten liberal positions (the `support` variable) on ten different issues. Each row in this dataset is one person's response to one of the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was also an experiment at this point, which we'll describe in more detail in part 2 of this problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After recording the respondents' positions on each issue, the researchers ask respondents about their gender (`male`), race (`white`), age (`age`), their approval of Trump on a 5-point scale (`trump_approve`) and their party identification (`party`).\n",

    "- `party`: what political party the respondent said they identified with; equal to `\"democrat\"`, `\"republican\"`, or `\"independent\"`\n",

    "### Part 1: Analyzing the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the authors were interested in whether our issue views cause us to pick our political loyalties (to parties or politicians) or, rather, if our political loyalties (to parties and politicians) cause our issue views. To examine this big question, the authors decided to investigate whether telling people about Donald Trump's positions on the issues on the survey would change survey respondent's own stated views on these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors thought that Donald Trump represented a unique opportunity to examine these questions because Trump had previously expressed both liberal and conservative positions on all ten issues at various times. It's not common that Republican politicians express liberal views on issues, so they took this unique opportunity to see how both Democrats and Republicans would react to (accurate!) information about the liberal positions on these issues that Trump had espoused (at one point in time).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, the respondents to this survey were randomly assigned to various treatment conditions. For this assignment, we will focus only (and you only have data on) the following 2 treatment conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control group (`treat` equals `\"control\"`): respondents were asked of whether they support or oppose the liberal position\n",
    "- Liberal Trump group (`treat` equals `\"libtrump\"`): respondents were first told that Donald Trump *supports* the liberal position, then the respondents were asked of whether they support or oppose the liberal position\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the example of the question on the minimum wage. Those in the control group would see the following version of the minimum wage question:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](self.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "But those randomly assigned to the \"liberal Trump\" group would see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](liberal_trump.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above, the liberal Trump group simply includes the additional sentence \"Donald Trump has said that he supports the policy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the respondents were in the same treatment condition for *all* of the 10 questions. For example, if a respondent was shown the liberal Trump position for the minimum wage in the question text, she would also see the liberal Trump position for the Iran Nuclear Deal in the question text as well.\n",
