    "- Just like with your in-class assignments, most of the questions in this problem set will be automatically graded. Therefore, you need to answer the questions exactly as we asked them: if we ask you to compute something, write the code to compute that exact value.\n",
    "- Some of the coding questions below will tell you if you have the right or wrong answer if you run your code and then run the `ottr::check` cell just below it. (The multiple choice questions do not do this.)\n",
    "    - You'll know you got a question right if it says `\"All tests passed!\"` afterwards.\n",
    "    - If you see an error when you run the check cell, it means you got the question wrong and should try again. The question should show a hint.\n",
    "    - If you don't see anything when you run the check cell, this means the question _doesn't tell you_ if you got the right or wrong answer.\n",
    "- Some of the questions below are short answer questions and will be graded by a GSI. For these questions, we expect around 1-2 sentences on average. You just need to write enough to answer the question, don't stress about how short your answer is. To encourage you not to write too much, your GSI will only mark the first 60 words to your answer. For many of these questions, you do *not* need to write all 60 words.\n",
    "- Do *not* convert your answers from decimals to percentages. For example, if you are asked the proportion of voters in `data` who are female, simply present `mean(data$female)` as your answer. Do _not_ multiply the expression by 100 to obtain a percentage.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Many social scientists believe the politicization of ethnicity in politics can be corrosive to democracy. For example, if ethnicity is politicized, people may engage in *ethnic voting*, in which they vote for in-group candidates and parties aimed at advancing the welfare *only* for their own groups. Yet, there are immensely diverse societies in which ethnicity is not very salient in politics. Mali, a landlocked country in West Africa, is one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Dunning and Harrison (2010)](http://www.thaddunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/CrossCutting_APSR-preprint.pdf)'s paper, they study a previously under-studied \"cross-cutting cleavage,\" which means an attribute where \"dimensions of identity or interest along which members of the same ethnic group may have diverse allegiances.\" In particular, they argue that the presence of *cousinage* is one reason why ethnic voting is not as strong in Mali.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is *cousinage*? During the Mali Empire (1230 to about 1600), families formed alliances on the basis of patronyms (i.e., surnames), even if were are of different ethnic or religious backgrounds. Even up to today, in countries such as current-day Mali (as well as Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, and Burkina Faso), members of different ethnic groups feel close to their so-called _\"joking cousins\"_ even if they are not from the same group. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, cousinage **cross-cuts** ethnicity. While people favor their co-ethnics, they also favor their joking cousins, who very often are not in the same ethnic group."

    "#### About the study\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunning and Harrison study whether the presence of this cross-cutting cleavage -- \"joking cousins\" -- helps reduce ethnic voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief description of the experiment's procedures from their paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To measure the effect of cousinage on voter preferences, we showed videotaped political speeches to experimental subjects, who were recruited through door-to-door canvassing in almost all neighborhoods in the capital city of Bamako. Subjects were told that the candidate in the video was a political independent who was considering launching a campaign for deputy in the National Assembly. [In all trials], we asked subjects to evaluate ... the attractiveness of the candidate (`global_eval`). **The content of speeches viewed by all subjects was identical. The experimental manipulation (`treat_assign`) consisted of what subjects were told about the politician’s last name, which conveys information about both ethnic identity and cousinage ties in Mali.** _(Emphasis and variable names added)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment conditions are:\n",
    "  1. Same ethnicity, joking cousin\n",
    "  2. Same ethnicity, not joking cousin\n",
    "  3. Different ethnicity, joking cousin\n",
    "  4. Different ethnicity, not joking cousin\n",

    "- `treat_assign_joking_cousin`: `1` if the subject was randomly assigned to a treatment group with a candidate who was a joking cousin, `0` otherwise\n",
    "- `actor`: this number indicates which actor each participant watched. Speeches were filmed in July 2008 in NYC, with two Malians actors. (`1`: Mamadou Doumbia; `2`: Bamadou Diallo)\n",
    "- `female`: equals `1` if the respondent identifies as female, `0` otherwise\n",

    "### Part IIa: Media Inﬂuence on Vote Choices: Unemployment News and Incumbents’ Electoral Prospects (5.5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Garz and Martin (2021)](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/epdf/10.1111/ajps.12539)'s paper, they look at how the mere fact that more / less news on unemployment is being reported can influence incumbent candidates' electoral prospects. Here is the abstract of their paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How does news about the economy influence voting decisions? We isolate the effect of the information environment from the effect of change in the underlying economic conditions themselves by taking advantage of left-digit bias. We show that unemployment figures crossing a round-number “milestone” cause a discontinuous increase in the amount of media coverage devoted to unemployment conditions, and we use this discontinuity to estimate the effect of attention to unemployment news on voting, holding constant the actual economic conditions on the ground. Milestone effects on incumbent U.S. governor vote shares are large and notably asymmetric: Bad milestone events hurt roughly twice as much as good milestone events help.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a milestone?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We apply the following criteria to find “bad” milestones in the state unemployment rate: (a) the rate exceeds a round number that it did not exceed in the previous month; and (b) the rate did not exceed the same round number in the 6 months prior to that event. Here, a round number is any value that contains a zero after the decimal point (e.g., 5.0% or 12.0%). Similarly, we consider it a “good” milestone if (a) the rate falls to or below a round number; and (b) the rate did not fall to or below the same round number in the 6 months before. We apply the same criteria to the state’s number of unemployed, except that a round number is any value that contains only zeros after the first digit (e.g., 700,000 or 2,000,000 unemployed people).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the main results from the regression. The dependent variable here is the vote share gained by the incumbent party / candidate, and the independent variables are whether there was a good / bad milestone in the last unemployment release before election day or not. Here is more information on the sample for the main findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sample includes 342 gubernatorial elections between 1994 and 2018. The incumbent governor was standing for reelection in 195 of these elections"

Moreover, they examine whether people who are less likely to reflect on their biases demonstrate this bias to a greater extent. In particular, using a two-wave survey-based experiment, they examine at how outside forces such as the #MeToo movement can promote reflection and reduce partisan-motivated evaluations of sexual misconducts.\n",

Across experimental groups, we manipulated the gender and partisanship of the accuser, and the gender and partisanship of the accused. In every scenario, either a woman accused a man or a man accused a woman (i.e., there were no same-sex scenarios). The vignette read as follows:\n",
