    "\n",
    "- Just like with your in-class assignments, most of the questions in this problem set will be automatically graded. Therefore, you need to answer the questions exactly as we asked them: if we ask you to compute something, write the code to compute that exact value.\n",
    "- Some of the coding questions below will tell you if you have the right or wrong answer if you run your code and then run the `ottr::check` cell just below it. (The multiple choice questions do not do this.)\n",
    "    - You'll know you got a question right if it says `\"All tests passed!\"` afterwards.\n",
    "    - If you see an error when you run the check cell, it means you got the question wrong and should try again. The question should show a hint.\n",
    "    - If you don't see anything when you run the check cell, this means the question _doesn't tell you_ if you got the right or wrong answer.\n",
    "- Some of the questions below are short answer questions and will be graded by a GSI. For these questions:\n",
    "    - We expect around 2-3 sentences on average. You just need to write enough to answer the question, don't stress about how short your answer is. \n",
    "    - To encourage you not to write too much, **your GSI will only mark the first 60 words to your answer**. For many of these questions, you do *not* need to write all 60 words.\n",
    "    - Focus on answering just the question asked. Don't reference unnecessary or unrelated concepts; if you mention something off topic that is incorrect, you will lose points for saying something incorrect.\n",
    "- Do *not* convert your answers from decimals to percentages. For example, if you are asked the proportion of voters in `data` who are female, simply present `mean(data$female)` as your answer. Do _not_ multiply the expression by 100 to obtain a percentage.\n",
    "- **IF YOU EMAIL YOUR GSI A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CODE, PLEASE ATTACH YOUR NOTEBOOK AS A .PDF IN YOUR EMAIL TO YOUR GSI SO THAT YOUR GSI CAN SEE ALL OF YOUR CODE. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE NOTEBOOK AS A .PDF BY GOING TO FILE $\\rightarrow$ DOWNLOAD AS $\\rightarrow$ PDF.**\n",
    "- Do not ask your GSI or the professor to look at your answer and tell you whether it is correct. We cannot give you the answers.\n",
    "- This is a completely individual assignment. You can discuss the problems with your classmates, but you must do your own work and write up your own answers.\n",

    "## Do Politicians Racially Discriminate Against Constituents?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set, we will explore some data from [Butler and Broockman (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00515.x)'s field experiment on whether state legislators racially discriminate against their constituents. (You do not need to read the study.)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the problem set, not only would you be able to review some key skills that you have picked up in the course so far, you would also be able to replicate some of the main findings from this study!"

To determine which names to use, the researchers used data from the US Census to find first and last names that are most distinctively Black or distinctively White--that is that, if you look at people with the names, a very high percentage of them either are Black or White. Based on the US Census data, the researchers used the names DeShawn Jackson for the Black name/alias (`treat_deshawn` equal `1`) and Jake Mueller for the White name/alias (`treat_deshawn` equals `0`).
