    "### What is multivariate regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, I mentioned that regression is _by far_ the most common tool social scientists use to analyze data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen _bivarate regression_, which uses just one predictor to predict the outcome, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`summary(lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = data))`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, regression finds the values of $m$ and $b$ in $y = mx + b$ that give us the best predictions about what y will be given a value of x. This was really easy to visualize as a scatter plot with a line of best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can actually use _multiple variables_ to predict an outcome, with code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`summary(lm(outcome ~ predictor.1 + predictor.2, data = data))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of $y = mx + b$, we instead have $y = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + b$, where we are adding more variables. In this case, regression does the same thing as it did before: it asks what values of $m_1$, $m_2$, and $b$ mean we'll make the best predictions about $y$ given values of $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we want to predict what percentage of people in Berkeley are wearing coats on a given day. This is probably influenced by both temperature and whether it's raining. Suppose we had a dataset on whether it was raining and what the temperature was every day in Berkeley. We can run separate regressions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`summary(lm(how.many.people.wearing.coats ~ temperature, data = data))`\n",
    "`summary(lm(how.many.people.wearing.coats ~ inches.of.rain, data = data))`\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can also just run one big regression, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`summary(lm(how.many.people.wearing.coats ~ temperature + inches.of.rain, data = data))`\n",
    "\n",
    "This would give us a formula for how to best predict the number of people wearing coats given a temperature and how many inches of rain fell that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work at the Berkeley Student Store and are trying to predict how many coats to stock on your shelves based on a weather forecast, this kind of prediction could be really useful. Again, remember, this is all just about making predictions, not causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this is the first use of multivariate regression: making better predictions about a $y$ variable using multiple $x$ varaibles."

    "### \"Controlling for\" other factors\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a second use: when trying to infer causality, reducing _omitted variable bias_. In particular, multivariate regression is also social scientists' most common tool for trying to reduce _omitted variable bias_ when making claims about causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $m_1$, $m_2$, and so on (you can have as many variables on the right hand side as you want) estimates we get tell us the predictions we'd make about how $y$ would change as $x_1$, $x_2$, or the other $x$ variables change _when holding constant all the other $x$ variables_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be helpful for reducing omitted variable bias, since we can examine the relationship between _one of_ our $x$ variables and $y$ while _holding constant_ other $x$ variables we include in the regression. This means holding constant potential omitted variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose someone ran this regression to argue that rain _causes_ people to wear coats:\n",
    "\n",
    "`summary(lm(how.many.people.wearing.coats ~ inches.of.rain, data = data))`\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential omitted variable is temperature: it's usually cold when it's raining, and it could be that when we compare rainy days to non-rainy days, what we're really comparing is warmer days (when it's less likely to rain) and colder days (when it's more likely to rain). By including `temperature` in the regression, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`summary(lm(how.many.people.wearing.coats ~ temperature + inches.of.rain, data = data))`\n",
    "\n",
    "we can now get estimates of the relationship between rain and whether people are wearing coats _while holding temperature constant_, no longer having to worry that it is an omitted variable."
