    "Today we'll examine a study from political scientists Andrew Hall and Jesse Yoder, who study the effects of home ownership on political behavior -- in particular, whether owning a home _causes_ people to be more likely to vote.\n",

    "This is obviously a difficult question to study. Simply comparing people who do and do not own homes would be a bad idea because of the potentialy for omitted variable bias. Yet, it's difficult to run an experiment on home ownership -- it's not really practical to randomly assign some people to get homes and not others.\n",

    "> We combine administrative data on more than 18 million voters in Ohio and North Carolina with deed-level data on property ownership. The resulting ... dataset allows us to track when individuals become homeowners and to see how often they turn out to vote in local and national elections. Using a ... difference-in-differences design to account for pre-existing differences between homeowners and non-homeowners, we find that becoming a homeowner substantially increases an individual’s propensity to participate in local elections.\n",

To estimate the effect of homeownership, what _are_ the two differences that Hall and Yoder then take the difference between?

The difference between (A - B) and (C - D) is their estimate of the effect of owning a home\" (but you need to fill in A, B, C, and D).\n"
