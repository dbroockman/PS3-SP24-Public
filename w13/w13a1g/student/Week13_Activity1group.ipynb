    "Today we'll examine a study by UC Berkeley economist Kate Pennington, who studied the impact of building new housing  in San Francisco. San Francisco, like the entire Bay Area, faces a housing affordability crisis -- housing there is some of the most expensive in the entire world, and many people are displaced (i.e., forced to move out of) their homes due to high and still-rising rents.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is fierce debate over whether building new housing would help reduce rent and displacement or actually make them worse. Some argue that building new housing would help lower rents and reduce this displacement by increasing housing supply and making landlords compete for tenants. But others argue that new housing generally houses wealthier people, who will \"gentrify\" a neighborhood--e.g., bring in amenities that cater to wealthier people such as expensive restaurants and nice coffee shops, etc.--and thereby allow landlords to charge even more for people to live in the area."
