    "### An estimate is a best guess, *close* to the true average treatment effect. But *how close*?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, when we conduct experiments, we are trying to learn about the *true* average treatment effect of some treatment on some outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've learned to get two things from an experiment:\n",
    "- An **estimate**: our best guess of the average treatment effect.\n",
    "- A **_p_-value**: the probability of seeing the estimate we did *if the treatment had no effect* on the outcome. (Remember: if the skeptic (we called her Sarah) were right, how likely is it that we would see an estimate as large as we did?)\n",
    "\n",
    "But even if an experiment's *p*-value is statistically significant and we conclude the treatment probably did have an effect, we know that the estimate is unlikely to be *exactly right*. There's still some noise in experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "And indeed, although it *is* likely that the true average treatment effect is *close* to the estimate, *how close*? As we learned, if the *standard error* is big, the estimate might be quite far away from the right answer. But a *standard error* is also hard to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll learn about *confidence intervals*, which allow us to say something more interpretable and more useful about how close to the estimate the true average treatment effect is likely to be.\n",

    "### Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we need confidence intervals. Confidence intervals give us a range of numbers that will contain the true average treatment effect a set percentage of the time. They consist of *two* numbers: a top and a bottom. The confidence interval is the range between the top and bottom of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 95% Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "By far the most common confidence intervals in social science are *95% confidence intervals*. **A 95% confidence interval has as 95% chance of including the true average treatment effect.** (Even more precisely: in 95% of experiments, the confidence interval will contain the true average treatment effect.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally in social science, we think of a 95% confidence interval as containing **the range of _plausible_ estimates of the average treatment effect**. For example, if Sarah is really pessimistic about a treatment, she can look at the 95% confidence interval and say, \"well, I think the right estimate is the very bottom of the range.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returning to the Vaccine Example\n",

    "Suppose Sarah is really skeptical about vaccines. She can look at Vaccine A's confidence interval and say, \"it's plausible that the effect is as low as a 31% decrease, which isn't much!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, suppose we just want the most effective vaccine. We could look at Vaccine A and think: \"it's plausible that the effect could be as low as 31%!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But because the experiment on Vaccine B is so much more precise, the lowest average treatment effect Sarah can really argue is _plausible_ is an 85% decrease. Or, likewise, if we're worried about getting the most effective vaccine, we can be assured that it's pretty unlikely the effect is any lower than a 85% decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this doesn't mean that it's *impossible* that the true effect is outside of the 95% confidence interval. But, by convention, we think of this as relatively unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 95% Confidence Intervals as Containing Most Optimistic and Most Pessimistic Plausible Values\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can think of the top/bottom of a confidence interval as containing the most optimistic/pessimistic scenario that is still plausible given the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you're looking at the effect of a treatment on something you want to see go up (e.g., effect of mail on voter turnout), the most optimistic plausible estimate would be the top of the confidence interval. So if the confidence interval for a mailer went from a 3.2pp effect on turnout to a 6.5pp effect on turnout, 6.5pp would be the most optimistic -- or \"best case\" -- plausible scenario. Likewise, 3.2pp would be the most pessimistic -- or \"worst case\" -- plausible scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula for 95% Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is calcualted from the estimate and the standard error. You don't need to memorize this, but:\n",
    "- $\\text{Top of 95% Confidence Interval} = \\text{Estimate} + 1.96 * \\text{Standard Error}$\n",
    "- $\\text{Bottom of 95% Confidence Interval} = \\text{Estimate} - 1.96 * \\text{Standard Error}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- The *middle* of the confidence interval is the estimate.\n",
    "- The *width* of the confidence interval is determined by the standard error. For example, the lower the standard error, the *narrower* the confidence interval will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warning: larger standard errors mean wider confidence intervals!\n",

    "\n",

(A precinct is a small local area, corresponding to the area containing all the people who vote at a particular polling place.) At party precinct conventions, they select who will go on to represent the precinct at the state's Republican convention. This position is called being a *state delegate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each precinct has a precinct chair who runs the party's precinct convention in that precinct. In the data, over 2,000 precint chairs were randomly assigned to receive one of four letters from the state party chair prior to these neighborhood caucus meetings. The Republican Party of Utah sent the precinct chairs a letter prior to the convention, but the contents varied by treatment group:\n",

    "- Control group: letter did not mention women and running for state delegate\n",
