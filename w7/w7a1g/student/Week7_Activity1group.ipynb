    "- `ally`: The authors thought that social lobbying might be especially effective among legislators who had supported the group's priorities in the past. To measure this, they asked the lobbyist: \"In your opinion, how well does the phrase â€˜ally of the interest groupâ€™ describe the legislator?\" This is therefore the lobbyists' rating of whether the legislator is an ally of the interest group (values 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1).\n",
